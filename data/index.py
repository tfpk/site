    "bio": """
My Name is Thomas Kunc. I'm a software developer, based in Sydney, Australia. 
I currently study at UNSW, and work at both Kinesis and UNSW.
I mainly work in Python, JavaScript and HTML/CSS, but also work and teach in C.
My main passions are for teaching, communication, and making technologies to help people.

When I'm not working on a computer, I debate competitively, adjudicate, and tabulate within the Australasian debating circuit.
I also sing, and have previously worked for Opera Australia as a child singer, and sung at St. Mary's Cathedral, Sydney.
