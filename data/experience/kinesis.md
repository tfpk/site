# Developer at Kinesis

Starting in early 2018 as a Graduate Data Analyst, I have contributed to multiple Kinesis projects.

Mainly responsible for internal data management tools written in python and pandas, I have refactored, tested, expanded and implemented features for multiple proects. I have also contributed to production code in Ruby, HTML and Javascript.

Outside of main responsiblities within the Product team as a developer, I have also contributed video editing skills for producing promotional films and performed client facing roles in a support position.
