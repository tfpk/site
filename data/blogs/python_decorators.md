# Decorators in python

Decorators in python are really hard to understand. This is a simple guide to using them that is hopefully instructive.

The most fundamental trick to understand them is knowing this:

    # given
    def decorator(f):
        f._decorated = True
        return f

    # this:

    def func():
        return
    func = decorator(func)

    # Is the same as:

    @decorator
    def func():
        return

Put in words, a decorator is a pretty way of modifying a function.
