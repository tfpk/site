        <h3>Bio</h3>
        <span class="flow-text">
          <p>
My name is Tom. I'm a second year Computer Science student at UNSW.
I tutor and admin COMP1511, and help out with other first year courses.
I don't want to spam you, so I've writen a few paragraphs about why I'm
running for Treasurer and Grievance Officer</p>
          <p>
I'm passionate about making CSESoc useful for everyone, and, if elected,
would focus on making events and programs that were useful for every 
student (undergrad and postgrad; and no matter where they're from).</p>

<p>Grievence officer is a new position, so I want to figure out what role
it can play in the community - if elected, I'll try to be as consultative
as possible with every member of CSESoc about what they want. I envision
a committee of people who can talk to new members, and are available to
the rest of the society as consultants for making events more accessible
and inclusive - for instance, a group of post-graduate students we can
ask about running events for postgraduates. I would also ensure that 
First Year Camp is run in an accessible way for everyone - whether they
party hard, or hardly party.</p>

<p>As Treasurer, my main intent would be to create tools to make the
society's finances easily inspected and received. I would like to explore
setting up software to automate a large part of the Treasurer's role away,
leading to faster reimbursements and more clarity about the society's 
finances.</p>

    <h3>Experience</h3>
        <span class="flow-text">
          <p>
As CSESoc Projects director, I helped manage a team of 50 people and 10 projects.
This involved organising interviews, and events. We also had to manage a budget,
and check in with our teams to make sure they were being effective.</p>
<p>
As COMP1511 Course Admin I've been responsible for over 1200 students, managing
my time and resources to ensure timely marking and assessment task release.
As a tutor, I've taught around 200 students programming, so I have an investment
both in the school and the future of the society. 

</p>
<p>
The other society I participate in is the UNSW Debating Society. They already have an eqivalent
of the grievance officer (called an Equity officer) and I would intend to take some of their
ideas and apply them here. For instance, I'd make sure that there's always someone contactable
at each event if somebody has problems or concerns; and that First Year Camp has people trained
to deal with any mental health or interpersonal issues.
