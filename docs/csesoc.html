        <h3>Bio</h3>
        <span class="flow-text">
          <p>
My name is Tom. I'm a second year Computer Science student at UNSW.
I tutor and admin COMP1511, and help out with other first year courses.
I don't want to spam you, so I've writen a few paragraphs about why I'm
running for Treasurer and Grievance Officer</p>
          <p>
I'm passionate about making CSESoc useful for everyone, and, if elected,
would focus on making events and programs that were useful for every 
student (undergrad and postgrad; and no matter where they're from).</p>

<p>Grievence officer is a new position, so I want to figure out what role
it can play in the community - if elected, I'll try to be as consultative
as possible with every member of CSESoc about what they want. I envision
a committee of people who can talk to new members, and are available to
the rest of the society as consultants for making events more accessible
and inclusive - for instance, a group of post-graduate students we can
ask about running events for postgraduates. I would also ensure that 
First Year Camp is run in an accessible way for everyone - whether they
party hard, or hardly party.</p>

<p>As Treasurer, my main intent would be to create tools to make the
society's finances easily inspected and received. I would like to explore
setting up software to automate a large part of the Treasurer's role away,
leading to faster reimbursements and more clarity about the society's 
finances.</p>
        </span>
    </div>

    <h3>Experience</h3>
        <span class="flow-text">
          <p>
As CSESoc Projects director, I helped manage a team of 50 people and 10 projects.
This involved organising interviews, and events. We also had to manage a budget,
and check in with our teams to make sure they were being effective.</p>
<p>
As COMP1511 Course Admin I've been responsible for over 1200 students, managing
my time and resources to ensure timely marking. As a tutor, I've taught around 200 students.
</p>
<p>
The other society I participate in is the UNSW debating society. They already have an eqivalent
of the grievance officer (called an Equity officer) and I would intend to take some of their
ideas and apply them here.
